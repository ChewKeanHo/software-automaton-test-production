***Automate Reliably. Scale Confidently.***

`Automaton` is `(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho`'s production-grade automation
toolchain that unifies your CI jobs across platforms using **ONLY** plain shell
and PowerShell scripts bootstrapped by a single polyglot script. This includes
manual human intervention capability where one can debug the processes at will
without affecting the CI pipelines.

It solves the following business problems:

* **No Vendor Lock-In** - Take full control over your production process
  entirely. Your pipelines live in your repository, not in any provider's
  console. Hence, they outlive any single vendor's pricing or roadmap changes.
* **Zero Runtime Dependencies** - It just works! Automaton boots with what each
  OS already ships: a POSIX shell on Linux/macOS, PowerShell on Windows. Nothing
  to install before first use. In fact, use Automaton to install the tools and
  set up the environment instead!
* **Manual Intervention Capable** - Test any CI job on your own laptop before
  it touches CI: no more silly, noisy "fix CI" commits.
* **Full Downstream Freedom** - It merely streamlines all triggers into your
  CI shell scripts. You develop your own processes therein with absolute
  freedom!
* **Lightweight to Install** - Just unpack a few shell and PowerShell scripts.
  No complicated installer. No unused bloat.
* **Tested Across Platforms** - GitHub.com, GitLab.com, Codeberg.org,
  self-hosted Forgejo, etc. This project tests on them whenever runners are
  available.
* **Learnt From The Past** - 2nd generation development based on learning from
  its predecessor: the [`(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's AutomataCI`](https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/software-automataci).

## How It Works


The whole idea to unify both `Microsoft Windows` and `UNIX-based` operating
systems came from
[`(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's The Polyglot Scripts Research Project`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19805433).
Without the polyglot shell scripts, it is **VERY DIFFICULT** to unite all the
operating systems without compromise.

The sequence of actions are as follows:

```
trigger
  |
  ▼
.internals/automaton/Start.sh.ps1
  |
  ▼
.internals/automaton/presenters/init.{sh,ps1}
  |
  ▼
.internals/ci/jobs/[JOB]/start.{sh,ps1}
```

1. A human, robot, or schedule triggers the repository's CI pipeline.
2. Every trigger calls the `.internals/automaton/Start.sh.ps1` polyglot script.
3. The polyglot script natively identifies the shell type and locates the
   project's init shell or PowerShell script (defaulting to
   `.internals/automaton/presenters/init.{sh,ps1}`).
4. The polyglot script sources the init script to initialize the CI and locate
   the CI job directory via the `$AUTOMATON_DIRECTORY_JOBS` environment
   variable.
5. Automaton searches for the job's start script (default:
   `.internals/ci/jobs/[JOB]/start.{sh,ps1}`).
6. Automaton source-imports (a.k.a. 'dot-imports') the CI job start script and
   hands full control over.

That is all. It is now this simple compared to its predecessor. You get the full
freedom to develop your own process freely in the job's start scripts.

Due to this nature, a human can intervene in the automation process at any step
for localized process debugging and testing. Hence, one can test any job within
the laptop and computer before it touches actual CI pipelines.




## Installation & Updates


To use `(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Automaton` in your next project, the best
practices for installing, uninstalling, and updating are as follows:


### Download the Latest Version

To counter (nuisance) geopolitical threats, you can download the latest version
of `(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Automaton` from the following mirror:

| Location            | URL                                                         |
|:--------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| Global              | https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/software-automaton/releases   |
| Global              | https://codeberg.org/chewkeanho/software-automaton/releases |
| US (United States)  | https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/software-automaton/releases   |
| US (United States)  | https://gitlab.com/chewkeanho/software-automaton/-/releases |
| EU (European Union) | https://codeberg.org/chewkeanho/software-automaton/releases |
| EU (European Union) | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23129070                     |

1. You should download based on your extraction tool in your operating system
   such as but not limited to `tar`, `untar`, `gz`, `xz`, `zip`, or `unzip`.
   1. Note that although the packages are organized by operating systems, they
      are actually the same content. The packages are mainly for system
      compatibility purposes only.


### Unpack The Payload

Once done, unpack the payload in your local computer.

for `.tar.gz` and `.tar.xz`:

```
$ tar -xvf chewkeanho_automaton_[VERSION]_[OS]_[ARCH].tar.[COMPRESSION] -C /path/to/directory

----

Example (for 1.0.0, freebsd, all, xz):

$ tar -xvf chewkeanho_automaton_1.0.0_freebsd_all.tar.xz -C /path/to/directory
```

for `.zip`:

```
$ unzip -d /path/to/directory chewkeanho_automaton_[VERSION]_[OS]_[ARCH].zip

----

Example (for 1.0.0, windows, all):

$ unzip -d /path/to/directory chewkeanho_automaton_1.0.0_windows_all.zip
```


### Copy/Overwrite into Your Repository

Place or overwrite existing `automaton/` directory inside your root repository
with such pathing:

```
your_project/
  |
  +-- .git/
  |
  +-- .internals/
          |
          +-- automaton/            <-- place or overwrite automaton/ here
```

That is how you add|update `(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Automaton` into your
project.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The location can be any place inside the repository. The above is the default
> recommended location for keeping the repository clean.

Once done, provide execute permission to the script once:

```
cd your_project
$ chmod +x ./.internals/automaton/Start.sh.ps1
```

Then run `help` command from it:

```
$ ./.internals/automaton/Start.sh.ps1 help
```

If it works, your installation is now successful!



### Setup or Update CI Jobs Directory

If a CI job directory already exists, skip this step. Otherwise, setup or update
your CI Job directory as follows:

```
your_project/
  |
  +-- .git/
  |
  +-- .internals/
          |
          +-- automaton/
          |
          +-- ci/
               |
               +-- jobs/
                     |
                     +-- [JOB]/                <-- job name
                           +-- start.ps1       <-- PowerShell starter script
                           +-- start.sh        <-- POSIX Shell starter script
```

1. Basically, the directory name inside `.internals/ci/jobs/` is the job name.
   Have the freedom to create yours.
2. What you NEED to make sure are:
   1. The `[JOB]` name is as intended; AND
   2. There is a `start.ps1` for the `[JOB]`'s PowerShell starter script; AND
   3. There is a `start.sh` for the `[JOB]`'s POSIX Shell starter script.
3. You can create as many `[JOB]` as you like.

Once done, to check `(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Automaton` search
functionalities, simply call `help` command again and observe the list of jobs
available to run. If your `[JOB]` directory name is listed, it is linked
correctly.

```
$ ./.internals/automaton/Start.sh.ps1 help
...
I: _________________________________________________________________________
I:
I: [JOBS]:
I:      * Archive                   <-- look for your [JOB] directory name here
I:      * Build
...
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> The CI directory can be explicitly defined to elsewhere using
> `$AUTOMATON_DIRECTORY_JOBS` (PowerShell: `${env:AUTOMATON_DIRECTORY_JOBS}`)
> environment variable. The above uses the default search path which is
> `.internals/ci/jobs/` directory.
>
> Example of such execution:
>
> ```
> AUTOMATON_DIRECTORY_JOBS=/path/to/elsewhere ./.internals/automaton/Start.sh.ps1 run [JOB]
> ```

> [!NOTE]
>
> For quick and lazy setup, the package actually distributes a default set of
> tested CI jobs as `ci/` directory. Refer below for instructions.



### Setup or Update CI Triggers

If there are CI triggers readily available, skip this step. Otherwise, setup or
update as follows:

```
your_project/
  |
  +-- .git/
  |
  +-- .github/
  |       |
  |       +-- workflows/
  |               |
  |               +-- [NAME].yml    <-- automated triggers in GitHub and Forgejo
  |
  |
  +-- .gitlab-ci.yml                <-- automated triggers in GitLab
```

Now that your CI jobs are linked, you can go ahead and run the job locally as:

```
$ ./.internals/automaton/Start.sh.ps1 run [JOB]
```

If your init script is internally working fine by default, you should see
`(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Automaton` is able to run it seamlessly.

What you did is **manual triggering**. It allows you to check and debug any of
your CI steps locally.

Once you are satisfied, you can work on your automated CI triggers like
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions),
[GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/),
[Forgejo Actions](https://forgejo.org/docs/next/user/actions/reference/), etc.

> [!NOTE]
>
> For quick and lazy setup, the package actually distributes a default and
> tested set of CI configuration files namely `github-ci.yml` and
> `gitlab-ci.yml` matching the distributed default set as `ci/` directory. You
> can place them as follows:
>
> ```
> your_project/
>   |
>   +-- .git/
>   |
>   +-- .github/
>   |       |
>   |       +-- workflows/
>   |               |
>   |               +-- git-push.yml    <-- rename and place github-ci.yml here
>   |
>   |
>   +-- .gitlab-ci.yml                  <-- rename and place gitlab-ci.yml here
>   |
>   +-- .internals/
>           |
>           +-- automaton/              <-- place automaton here
>           |
>           +-- ci/                     <-- place ci directory here
> ```
>
> These default configuration files **REQUIRE** you to set the `$RUNNERS` CI
> variable for selecting the required runners.
>
> GitLab does not mandate its CI YAML file at the root repository. The location
> can be customized to elsewhere via the repository's settings:
>
> ```
> Settings > CI/CD > General Pipelines > CI/CD configuration file
> ```
>
> For GitHub (`Repository > Settings > Secrets and Variables > Variables`), you
> provide a JSON body provisioning the runners matrix. An example:
>
> ```
> { "os": [ "ubuntu-latest", "windows-latest", "macos-latest" ] }
> ```
>
> For GitLab (`Repository > Settings > Variables > Project Variables`), you
> provide a no-whitespace JSON body provisioning the wanted runners. An example:
>
> ```
> {"os":["saas-linux-small-amd64","saas-windows-medium-amd64"]}
> ```
>
> Unlike GitHub, for GitLab, you may need to add/remove runners by updating your
> `.gitlab-ci.yml` from time to time especially dealing with local runners.
>
> For Gitea and Forgejo, they use GitHub settings inherently so no additional
> configurations are required.



### You Are Done!

Once they are in place, commit and make a test run! If everything works out
fine, you should only be working on growing your `.internals/ci/jobs/`
directory.

If you wish to uninstall it, simply walk backwards through this guide.

Enjoy!




## Verifying Content Integrity


To secure the content from unauthorized modification by anyone down to bit-level
(`0|1`), they are cryptographically signed using one or more cryptography tools
such as but not limited to:

* [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org); AND/OR
* [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/).

The public key and the associated certificate are attached. Only the main owner
keeps and maintains the private keys. To verify the content's integrity:



### GnuPG

1. Install [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org) software if not present.
2. Download the target file and its detached signature file (the `.asc` file
   with the same filename).
3. Download the public key file (`.gpg`).
4. Place them next to each other in the directory.
5. Open a terminal and execute the following command:

```
$ gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /path/to/public.gpg --verify /path/to/file.asc
```



### OpenSSL

1. Install [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org) software if not present.
2. Download the target file and its detached signature file (the `.sig`/`.sign`
   file with the same filename).
3. Download the public certificate file (`.pem`) containing the public key
   within.
4. Place them next to each other in the directory.
5. Open a terminal and execute the following command:

```
$ openssl dgst -verify /path/to/pubkey.pem -signature /path/to/file.sig /path/to/file
```
